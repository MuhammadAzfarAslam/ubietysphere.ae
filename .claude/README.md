# .claude Documentation Folder

This folder contains reference documentation for AI assistants and developers working on the UbietySphere.ae project.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `APPOINTMENT_MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md` | Complete backend documentation for the Appointment module - API endpoints, business rules, email templates, database schema |
| `FRONTEND_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md` | Analysis of frontend gaps compared to backend capabilities, with implementation priorities |

## Usage

These files are meant to be read by AI assistants (like Claude) to understand:
- Backend API structure and capabilities
- Business rules and validations
- What's implemented vs what's missing
- Implementation priorities

## Updating

When backend provides new documentation or features are implemented:
1. Add new documentation files here
2. Update `FRONTEND_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md` to mark completed items
3. Keep files organized by module/feature
